# TBXT2035

0.0 Baseline
* Start with the PDB of known residue structures
* Use ftmap to find binding pockets
* Develop pharmacophores

0.1 - Done
* Generate predicted pdb of TBXT

1.0 Weighted Ensemble
* Run 1 microsecond simulation
* Simulation must be weighted ensemble

1.1 Replica Exchange
* If necessary

2.0
* Use ML to replicate synthetic conformations for TBXT (ICoN)

3.0
* Test pharmacaphores on "more probable" synthetic conformations
