# TBXT2035
https://tbxtchallenge.org/

-1.0 Baseline - What others have done
* Start with the PDB of known residue structures (half the protein)
* Use ftmap to find binding pockets
* Develop pharmacophores

0.0 - Done
* Generate predicted pdb of TBXT
* Alphafold/Boltz

1.0 Ensemble sampling
* Run 1 microsecond simulation
* Simulation must be weighted ensemble

1.1 Replica Exchange
* If necessary to get more synthetic conformations

2.0
* Use ML to find synthetic conformations for TBXT (ICoN)

3.0
* Test pharmacaphores on "more probable" synthetic conformations
